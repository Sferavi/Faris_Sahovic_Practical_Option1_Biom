## Approach and journey
Firstly, I want to say that this project was something new based on my previous experience.
What I mean by that is that it was structuraly different by design.
In the start I was very confused on how I should approach it, and thus made a mistake of hardcoding a lot of components.
I realized that it was not a beneficial in long term and have made a new git hub repository to do it all over again with 
better coding structure.
A lot of harships came from positioning provided assets, but in the end I got better at it.

## Tips / Instructions / Issues

For any other question you can contact me on my email: farisahovic@gmail.com

- Project is fully compatible with design specified screen (Laptop L aspect ratio), however because I haven't
optimised given images it can affect it's structure to not fully load when resizing the page

How to check it out on different aspect ratios?

Just close the inspect screen and run it again for that aspect ratio to fully load it.

- Google fonts have been used instead of provided Adobe fonts, and thus may add another row to original text because of differences
from original 

- Navigation items do not lead to any page, since it wasn't specified in the instructions

- Every css styling for component has a comment to divide the sections for easy readabilty (biom_styles.css)

- Every html component has a comment to divide the sections for easy readabilty (index.html)

- styles.css is a bootstrap styling sheet

- ocean video's opacity has been changed for better visibility
